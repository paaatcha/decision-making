# Decision making algorithms
This repository contains my implementation related to two decision-decision making algorithms:
* [TOPSIS](https://github.com/paaatcha/Decision-Making/tree/master/TOPSIS)
* [TODIM](https://github.com/paaatcha/Decision-Making/tree/master/TODIM)

In addition, it also contains the framework [A-TOPSIS](https://github.com/paaatcha/Decision-Making/tree/master/A-TOPSIS). For more information about A-TOPSIS, [click here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06998).

You also can combine these codes with the [Fuzzy Numbers](http://github.com/paaatcha/fuzzy) in order to produce the Fuzzy-(TOPSIS, TODIM). [Check this paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6514yjd7py0hiyk/IF-TODIM%20An%20intuitionistic%20fuzzy%20TODIM%20to%20multi-criteria.pdf?dl=0).


All directions are given in the comments in the codes.

If you find any bug, please, email-me.
